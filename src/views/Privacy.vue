                                        We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. Any Personal
                                        Data collected by us is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to
                                        such systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to store your
                                        data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that would not have
                                        arisen had the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately no transmission of data over the
                                        internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of
                                        Trolli to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect
                                        your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such
                                        transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure,
                                        please contact us.<br /><br />

                                        You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However,

                                        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you have the
                                        right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
                                        ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact
                                        you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

                              any way limit the term which they serve to illustrate. Any email addresses set out in this policy may be used solely for
                              the purpose for which they are stated to be provided, and any unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless otherwise
                              required by law, we reserve the right to not respond to emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject matter for
                              which we have provided an email address. As a matter of common sense, you are more likely to get a reply if your request
                              or question is polite, reasonable and there is no relatively obvious other way to deal with or answer your concern or
                              question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website etc.). <br />

                              Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of Trolli, waive rights or make representations (whether contractual
                              or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a Trolli address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or
                              any official public announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any Trolli rights,
                              the email content will be read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine
                              correspondence expressed to be from the Trolli legal department.
